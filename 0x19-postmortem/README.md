# Postmortem

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** May 10, 2024, 10:00 AM - May 11, 2024, 3:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** The API service decided to take a nap, resulting in users twiddling their thumbs for responses. Approximately 30% of users were affected, spending more time contemplating the meaning of life than getting their data.
- **Root Cause:** The database connection pool threw a tantrum due to a sudden surge in requests, causing it to curl up in a ball and refuse to play nice.

**Timeline:**

- **10:00 AM:** Monitoring alerts started shouting about high response times, interrupting everyone's peaceful morning coffee.
- **10:15 AM:** Engineers dove into action, initially suspecting gremlins in the network cables.
- **12:00 PM:** A wild assumption appeared! DDoS attack! Security team called in to fend off the invisible invaders.
- **2:00 PM:** Realizing the gremlins were on vacation, the issue was escalated to the database administrators for a serious chat.
- **6:00 PM:** Database administrators uncovered the true culprit - the grumpy database connection pool refusing to make new friends.
- **8:00 PM:** Temporary fix deployed, convincing the connection pool to expand its social circle temporarily.
- **3:00 AM:** Permanent solution implemented, teaching the connection pool some meditation techniques to handle stress better.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:** The database connection pool suffered a case of stage fright due to a sudden influx of requests, resulting in intermittent outages.
- **Resolution:** Database administrators performed some therapy on the connection pool, increasing its capacity temporarily and implementing long-term strategies to manage stress.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Teach the database to do some deep breathing exercises during traffic spikes.
  - Upgrade monitoring to include stress levels of database components.
  - Host a team-building workshop for the database connection pool to improve its social skills.

- **Tasks:**
  1. Implement auto-scaling for database resources to prevent future meltdowns.
  2. Enhance monitoring to include the emotional well-being of database components.
  3. Conduct a performance audit of database queries to reduce stress levels.
  4. Organize a support group for database connection pools to share coping mechanisms.
  5. Update incident response procedures to include hugs for the database when it's feeling down.
