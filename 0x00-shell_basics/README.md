# Project 0x00. Shell Basics

This project was carried out during my fullstack software engeneering training at [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) and aims to practive the basic commands related to the navigation snd file management in shell.

## Technologies

- Script written in bash
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.4

## Files

Each of the following line is a shell script file except school.mgc.
