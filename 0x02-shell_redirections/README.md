# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirection, and filter project

The project 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirection, and filter is the third project carried out to learn Shell. The project aimed to implement what we had learned about filtering information and redirecting the input and outputs of the different commands. some of the commands we used in this project are (find, head, tail, wc, sort uniq...) which are very helpful when it comes to filtering files and their content.
