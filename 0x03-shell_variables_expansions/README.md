# Shell Variables Expansions Project
This project was the fourth we carried out during our training on shells. It aimed to practice data expansions (Transforming variables and commands in their actual value). In this project, we performed (variable expansion, command substitution, parameter expansion...). We also learned how to create aliases, use them, and also how to undo them.

## Technologies
for this project we used 

- Script written in bash
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.4

| FILES | DESCRIPTION |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [`0-alias`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/0-alias) | A script that creates  an alias with the name ls and the value *rm \** |
| [`1-hello_you`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/1-hello_you) | A script that prints hello user, where user is the current Linux user.  |
| [`2-path `](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/2-path) | Add /action to the PATH. /action should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program. |
| [`3-paths`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/3-paths) | A script that counts the number of directories in the PATH.  |
| [`4-global_variables`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/4-global_variables) | A script that lists environment variables. |
| [`5-local_variables`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/5-local_variables) | A script that lists all local variables and environment variables, and functions. |
| [`6-create_local_variable`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/6-create_local_variable) | A script that creates a new local variable with the name *BEST* and the value *School*  |
| [`7-create_global_variable`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/7-create_global_variable) | A script that creates a new global variable with the name *BEST* and the value *School* |
| [`8-true_knowledge`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/8-true_knowledge) | A  script that prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable *TRUEKNOWLEDGE*, followed by a new line. |
| [`9-divide_and_rule`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/9-divide_and_rule) | A  script that prints the result of *POWER* divided by *DIVIDE*, which are environment variables, followed by a new line. |
| [`10-love_exponent_breath`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/10-love_exponent_breath) | script that displays the result of *BREATH* to the power *LOVE*, which are environment variables. |
| [`11-binary_to_decimal`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/11-binary_to_decimal) | A script that converts a number from base 2 to base 10. The number in base 2 is stored in the environment variable *BINARY* and the script should display the number in base 10, followed by a new line. |
| [`12-combinations`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/12-combinations) | a script that prints all possible combinations of two letters, except *oo*. Letters are lowercase, from a to z, One combination per line, The output should be alpha-ordered, starting with aa, Do not print oo, Your script file should contain a maximum of 64 characters. |
| [`13-print_float`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/13-print_float) | A script that prints a number with two decimal places, followed by a new line, the number is in the environment variable *NUM* |
| [`100-decimal_to_hexadecimal`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/100-decimal_to_hexadecimal) |A script that converts a number from base 10 to base 16. The number in base 10 is stored in the environment variable *DECIMAL*, The script should display the number in base 16, followed by a new line.|
| [`101-rot13`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/101-rot13) | A script that encodes and decodes text using the rot13 encryption. Assume ASCII. |
| [`102-odd`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/102-odd) | A script that prints every other line from the input, starting with the first line. |
| [`103-water_and_stir`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x03-shell_variables_expansions/103-water_and_stir) | shell script that adds the two numbers stored in the environment variables WATER and STIR and prints the result. WATER is in base water, STIR is in base stir. The result should be in base bestchol . |
